# Phase 5: Business Logic Verification

## Accommodation Logic

| Question | Answer | Severity |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Can rooms actually fill up? | **No.** `current_occupancy` is never incremented when a room is assigned. | 🔴 Critical |
| Can capacity be exceeded? | **Yes.** No capacity check exists in `assignRoom`. Comment says "relying on wardens for strict enforcement." | 🔴 Critical |
| Can gender rules be violated? | **Yes.** No gender check exists. A female athlete can be assigned to "Boys Hostel A." | 🔴 Critical |
| Can duplicate allocations occur? | **Yes.** No uniqueness constraint on room assignment. Multiple athletes can be assigned the same room past capacity. | 🟡 High |
| Can reassignment happen? | **Yes.** Simple `UPDATE` overwrites previous assignment. Old occupancy count is never decremented. | 🟡 High |

## Food Logic

| Question | Answer | Severity |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Can meals be consumed twice? | **No.** `UNIQUE(athlete_id, meal_type)` constraint prevents this. | ✅ Correct |
| Can QR codes be reused by different people? | **No.** QR encodes chest number which maps to a unique profile. | ✅ Correct |
| Can breakfast still be claimed at dinner? | **Yes.** No time-window validation. A "day1_breakfast" can be redeemed at midnight. | 🟡 High |
| Can race conditions create duplicates? | **Unlikely.** DB unique constraint is the guard. But the application-level check + insert is not atomic. Narrow window exists. | 🟡 Medium |

## Call Room Logic

| Question | Answer | Severity |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Can attendance be spoofed? | **Yes.** Anyone with a chest number can call `checkIntoCallRoom` directly. No verification the scanner is an actual official. | 🟡 High |
| Can athletes check in multiple times? | **No.** `UNIQUE(athlete_id, event_id)` on `call_room_logs`. | ✅ Correct |
| Can late arrivals be detected? | **No.** No comparison against `call_room_time`. Only records timestamp. | 🟡 Medium |

## Event Logic

| Question | Answer | Severity |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Heat generation | **Not implemented.** | 🔴 Critical |
| Lane generation | **Not implemented.** | 🔴 Critical |
| Qualification logic | **Not implemented.** Rules exist in DB but zero processing code. | 🔴 Critical |
| Result entry | **Not implemented.** | 🔴 Critical |
| Semi-finals / Finals progression | **Not implemented.** | 🔴 Critical |

---

# Phase 6: Dynamic Event Engine Verification

| Question | Answer | Evidence |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Are events hardcoded? | **Partially.** The 4-day schedule is seeded via SQL migration (0008). New events CAN be created via Event Builder UI. | Event Builder form writes to DB |
| Are categories configurable? | **Yes.** Category is a VARCHAR field, not an enum. | `ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN category VARCHAR(50)` |
| Can new events be created without code changes? | **Yes.** Event Builder form allows creation. | `createDynamicEvent` server action |
| Can qualification rules be configured? | **Schema only.** Rules exist in DB but are never evaluated by any code. | `qualification_rules` table has 3 seeded rules, zero consumers |
| Can lane allocation rules be changed? | **No.** No lane allocation logic exists. | Zero code |
| Can field event rules be changed? | **No.** No field event logic exists. | Zero code |
| Can decathlon/heptathlon be configured? | **No.** `scoring_rules` table exists but has zero rows and zero consumers. | Empty table, no UI |

**Verdict**: The Dynamic Event Engine is a **well-designed schema with zero business logic implementation**. The database architecture is genuinely good — JSONB config fields, proper relationships, round/heat hierarchy. But it is an empty engine with no fuel.

## Table-by-Table Analysis

| Table | Indexes | Missing Constraints | Data Integrity Risks |
|-------|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| `profiles` | PK, UNIQUE(chest_number), UNIQUE(user_id) | No gender validation enum. No CHECK on `role`. | Role can be set to any string. |
| `events` | PK, UNIQUE(code), UNIQUE(official_pin) | No CHECK on `status`. `start_date`/`end_date` have no relationship constraint. | `end_date` can be before `start_date`. |
| `accommodations` | PK, UNIQUE(warden_pin) | No CHECK on capacity > 0. `current_occupancy` never updated by application. | Occupancy field is permanently stale. |
| `food_logs` | PK, UNIQUE(athlete_id, meal_type) | No CHECK on `meal_type` format. | Any arbitrary string accepted as meal_type. |
| `call_room_logs` | PK, UNIQUE(athlete_id, event_id) | None significant. | Clean. |
| `event_results` | PK, UNIQUE(heat_id, profile_id) | No CHECK on rank > 0. | Zero rows. Never used. |
| `venues` | PK | References `events` but never queried. | **Orphaned table.** |
| `qualification_rules` | PK | None. | 3 rows seeded. Never read by application logic. |
| `scoring_rules` | PK | None. | **0 rows.** Completely empty and unused. |

---

# Phase 8: API Audit

This application uses **Next.js Server Actions** instead of traditional REST APIs. There are no `/api/` routes.

| Action | Auth Check | Authorization | Input Validation | Error Handling | Security Risk |
|--------|-----------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|--------------|
| `loginWithId` | N/A (login) | N/A | Trims + uppercases input | Returns error strings | 🟡 No rate limiting |
| `adminLogin` | N/A (login) | Checks `role=admin` | Basic null check | Returns error strings | 🟡 No rate limiting, no password |
| `logout` | None | None | None | N/A | ✅ Clean |
| `assignRoom` | **None** | **None** | Checks for null fields | Basic error return | 🔴 **Any user can call this** |
| `createDynamicEvent` | **None** | **None** | Checks name/code | Basic error return | 🔴 **Any user can create events** |
| `updateArrivalStatus` | **None** | **None** | Checks profileId | Basic error return | 🔴 **Any user can change any athlete's status** |
| `checkIntoCallRoom` | **None** | **None** | Validates athlete + registration | Good validation | 🟡 No official verification |
| `redeemFoodPass` | **None** | **None** | Validates athlete + uniqueness | Good validation | 🟡 No volunteer verification |
| `scanWardenCheckIn` | **None** | **None** | Validates athlete + assignment | Good validation | 🟡 No warden verification |

> [!CAUTION]
> **CRITICAL**: None of the server actions verify that the caller has the appropriate role. Any authenticated user (or even an unauthenticated script) can call `assignRoom`, `createDynamicEvent`, or `updateArrivalStatus` for any profile. The server actions are "use server" functions with no authorization middleware.

---

# Phase 9: Security Audit

| Category | Finding | Severity |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Authentication** | PIN-only login. No password, no 2FA, no Supabase Auth. Session is a JSON-serialized cookie. | 🔴 Critical |
| **Session Management** | Session cookie is `httpOnly` and `secure` in production. Contains raw role/id. **Not signed or encrypted.** A user can craft their own session cookie and become admin. | 🔴 Critical |
| **Authorization** | Layout-level guards only. Server actions have ZERO authorization checks. | 🔴 Critical |
| **RLS Policies** | Every table has `USING (true)` — effectively RLS is disabled. All data is publicly readable AND writable via the anon key. | 🔴 Critical |
| **Supabase Client** | Uses the **anon key** for all operations, including writes. No service_role separation. | 🔴 Critical |
| **Input Validation** | Basic null checks. No sanitization. No length limits. No format validation for chest numbers. | 🟡 High |
| **SQL Injection** | Supabase client uses parameterized queries. Low risk. | ✅ Low |
| **XSS** | React auto-escapes by default. No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. | ✅ Low |
| **Privilege Escalation** | Trivial. Edit the `sportsos_session` cookie JSON to `{"role":"admin","id":"A001"}`. Instant admin access. | 🔴 Critical |
| **QR Forgery** | QR contains plain text chest number. Anyone who knows a chest number can forge a QR. | 🟡 High |
| **Rate Limiting** | None on any endpoint. | 🟡 High |
| **Secrets Management** | `.env.local` with Supabase URL and anon key. Not in git. Acceptable for dev. | ✅ Acceptable |

---

# Phase 10: Architecture Audit

| Category | Assessment | Score |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Frontend Architecture** | Next.js App Router. Clean separation of layouts per role. Good use of Server Components for data fetching. CSS is inline-heavy with some CSS files. No state management library (not needed at this scale). | 6/10 |
| **Backend Architecture** | Server Actions only. No API layer. No middleware. No authorization layer. No service layer. Business logic is scattered across thin action files. | 3/10 |
| **Database Design** | The schema is actually the strongest part. Proper UUIDs, foreign keys, junction tables, JSONB for flexible configs. The Dynamic Event Engine schema (0007) is genuinely well-designed for extensibility. | 7/10 |
| **Scalability** | Single Supabase instance. No caching. No connection pooling consideration. Server-side rendered pages hit DB on every request. | 3/10 |
| **Maintainability** | Small codebase (~30 files). Easy to understand. But inline styles make UI changes painful. No tests. No TypeScript types for DB entities. | 4/10 |
| **Code Duplication** | Scanner pattern (QR + manual input) is copy-pasted across 3 files (referee, warden, volunteer). Should be a shared component. | 4/10 |
| **Technical Debt** | Orphaned `/admin/food` directory. Orphaned `venues` table. Debug `console.log` statements in production auth code. Old `check-db.mjs`, `test-login.mjs`, `test-supabase.mjs` scattered in root. | 🟡 Medium |

---

# Phase 11: Reality Check

> **If VTU asked to run a real 4-day athletics meet tomorrow with 1500 athletes using this application, could it?**

## Verdict: **Prototype Only**

### What works RIGHT NOW for a live event:
1. ✅ Athletes can log in with chest numbers
2. ✅ Athletes can see their accommodation assignment
3. ✅ Athletes can update their arrival status
4. ✅ Wardens can scan athletes at hostels
5. ✅ Food volunteers can scan meals (prevents double consumption)
6. ✅ Officials can scan call room attendance
7. ✅ Admin can see a live dashboard of basic stats
8. ✅ Digital ID card with QR code

### What CANNOT work for a live event:
1. ❌ **No way to import 1500 athletes** — they must be manually inserted via SQL
2. ❌ **No result entry** — the core feature of a sports meet
3. ❌ **No heat/lane management** — cannot run track events
4. ❌ **No live results** — spectators and athletes cannot see outcomes
5. ❌ **No medal table** — cannot determine winners
6. ❌ **No notifications** — athletes won't know when to report
7. ❌ **Security is non-existent** — anyone can become admin by editing a cookie
8. ❌ **Food pass only covers Day 1** — a 4-day event needs 12+ meals, only 5 are configured
9. ❌ **No venue/schedule management UI** — schedules are hardcoded in SQL

# Phase 13: Brutal Assessment

## What Was Designed Well
1. **Database schema for the Dynamic Event Engine (0007)** — genuinely good relational modeling with JSONB flexibility. Rounds → Heats → Results hierarchy is correct.
2. **QR-based scanning pattern** — using the same QR code for food, call room, and warden check-in is operationally elegant.
3. **Server-side rendering for data pages** — using Next.js Server Components for dashboard data fetching is the correct architectural choice.
4. **Food consumption duplicate prevention** — the DB constraint + application check is a solid two-layer defense.
5. **Call room check-in logic** — validates registration, prevents duplicates, clean error messages.

## What Was Designed Poorly
1. **Security model is fundamentally broken.** An unsigned JSON cookie as the sole authentication mechanism is unacceptable. This is not "needs improvement" — it is architecturally unsound.
2. **RLS is effectively disabled.** `USING (true)` on every table means the Supabase anon key can read and write anything directly, bypassing the application entirely.
3. **Server Actions have zero authorization.** A curl request can create events, assign rooms, or modify any athlete's status.
4. **The Scanner component is copy-pasted 3 times** with near-identical code (referee, warden, volunteer). This should be a single reusable `<ScannerWidget>`.

## Dangerous Assumptions
1. **"Relying on wardens for strict enforcement"** (comment in `assignRoom`) — trusting humans to enforce capacity when the software explicitly doesn't is operationally dangerous.
2. **PIN-only authentication is secure enough** — it is not. PINs are short, predictable strings like `WARDEN-BOYS-A`.
3. **Food meal types as hardcoded strings** — there is no master list of valid meals, so any string can be submitted.
4. **Static event schedule in athlete home page** — `100m Sprint (Men)` and `Tomorrow, 10:30 AM` are hardcoded JSX on the athlete home page, not fetched from DB.

## Overengineered Areas
1. **Dynamic Event Engine schema** — this is a production-grade schema bolted onto a prototype application. The schema can support World Athletics; the application can barely run a school sports day.

## Underengineered Areas
1. **Authentication/Authorization** — the entire security layer.
2. **Result processing** — the stated "flagship feature" has zero implementation.
3. **Athlete onboarding** — no import, no auto-ID generation. Manual SQL inserts only.

## Features That Will Fail in Production
1. **Food scanning at scale** — 1500 athletes at breakfast means ~50 scans/minute. The 3.5-second cooldown per scan will cause queues.
2. **Accommodation assignment** — without capacity checking, rooms will be over-assigned.
3. **Any concurrent operation** — no optimistic locking, no transactions for multi-step operations.

## Features That Are Surprisingly Strong
1. **Call Room Check-in** — validates registration, prevents duplicates, shows athlete details. Production-ready logic.
2. **Food Duplicate Prevention** — DB constraint is bulletproof against double-claims.
3. **Multi-role Login System** — the cascading check (event PIN → warden PIN → volunteer PIN → chest number) is clever and ergonomic.

# Final Verdict

| Dimension | Score |
|-----------|-------|
| **Architecture Score** | **4/10** |
| **Business Logic Score** | **3/10** |
| **Implementation Score** | **3/10** |
| **Production Readiness Score** | **1/10** |

## Overall Verdict

This is an **early-stage prototype** with a well-thought-out database schema but critically incomplete business logic. Approximately **20-25% of the plan.md vision** is actually implemented. The implemented portions (arrival tracking, food scanning, call room, QR identity) work correctly and demonstrate genuine understanding of the domain problem. However, the **core purpose of a sports event management system — running events and recording results — is entirely missing.** The security model is fundamentally broken and would need to be rebuilt before any real deployment.

## "Would you personally trust this system to run a VTU athletics meet with 1500 athletes and 4 days of events?"

**No. Absolutely not.**

The system can currently handle **registration check-in, accommodation viewing, and food scanning**. These are logistics operations that happen *around* the athletics meet. The actual athletics meet — heats, lanes, results, rankings, medals — has zero functional implementation. A referee logging in today would see a QR scanner for call room attendance and nothing else. There is no way to enter a single result. There is no way to generate a single heat. There is no way to publish a single ranking.

Additionally, the security model means that a curious student with browser dev tools could promote themselves to admin and modify the entire event database.

The database schema is the project's strongest asset and represents genuine architectural thinking. If the team executes Phase A and Phase B of the roadmap (roughly 8-10 weeks of focused development), this could become a viable system. But today, it is a prototype that demonstrates a vision, not a product that delivers one.
